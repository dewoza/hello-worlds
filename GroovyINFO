What was it designed for? (Web? Realtime?)
Easy to use, Java-friendly language for programming and scripting.

Advantages/Disadvantages compared to Java?

| Java | Groovy |
|------|--------|
| It is developed on JDK and is run on JVM | It is compiled to JVM Byte code and It is compatible with Java platform
| It is used as programming and object oriented Language | It is used as both programming and scripting Language
| In Java default access modifier package | In Groovy default access modifier public
| In Java, you need to provide getters and setters method for fields, especially if you are following Java Beans naming convention | In Groovy, getters and setters are automatically generated for class members
| In Java semicolons are compulsory | In Groovy semicolons are optional
| In Java only Java.lang.* package is imported by default | In Groovy commonly used packages are imported by default
| Java has primitive data types and wrapper classes to perform boxing and unboxing implicitly or explicitly | In Groovy everything is object and uses only object hence no concept of autoboxing or unboxing
| Java has a requirement of the main method inside a class to run the program | Groovy does not require any main method or entry point of a method to run the class or any program
